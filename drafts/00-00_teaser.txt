# TEASER

There are One Hundred Seventy known Leviathan-Class comets, most of which have eccentric *long period* orbits that bring them close to the sun every few hundred years. 

Historically, the proximity of the Leviathans has brought terrible visions, nightmares and disasters to earth, though this is now generally dismissed as primitive superstition.

Ten years ago, the Leviathan-Class comet Avalon crashed into the subarctic island of Odessa. It is the only such comet to have fallen to earth during the modern era, though there is some fringe speculation that ancient texts have referred to several such impacts in prehistoric times.

An international coalition of governmental and public agencies established a research installation to study the fallen comet.

The research station has drawn attention and industry from all corners of the globe. A city has risen in the crater of the Leviathan's impact.

## The City of Avalon - Pop. 98,000

Cuchulain meets her at a cafe. He can't believe his luck. Girls like this never talk to him. But his friends are right. There is something in the air, the entire island is buzzing with excitement. 

Ever since they went public with the news--The Avalon Project isn't so much concerned with the geological investigation of a giant rock fallen from space, as it is with the *repair* of a crash-landed space*ship* of undisclosed origin--it seems like anything is possible. Maybe that goes for sex, as well as science.

"Excuse me," she says. "Is that ... *Fall of the Sleeping Gods* you're reading?"

Cuchulain is caught off guard and he blinks at the girl over the cover of his paperback. She's gorgeous. Dark hair, sharp eyes and a tight sweater.

"Yes it is," he says. "Have you read it?"

The girl catches a condescending chirp of laughter before it fully escapes her mouth. "Not exactly," she says around her polished violet fingernails. "But I've heard all about it. The author--Merlaine?-- has been doing interviews and talks everywhere."

Cuchulain doesn't know what to say, so he just looks at her--he's been practicing keeping eye contact. He has to remind himself not to look away.
 
"Well?" she says. "What do you think?"

"I think you're ... gorgeou--"

"About the book, greenwood. What do you think about the book?"

Cuchulain can feel heat rising into his face as he stammers "I uh ... it's ... it's fun. I mean ... I don't think there's any way to prove that another of the Leviathan class comets ever actually fell to prehistoric earth. But you can't really disprove it either, right? He argues that some of Earth's worst tragedies and disasters have followed on the tail of 'Leviathan Landings,' as he calls them. ... It's basically conspiracy theory, but it's an interesting premise. It makes for a good read."

"What do you think happened to the original crew?"

"That's interesting. The first version of the book came out years ago, before the Avalon fell, right? Merlaine talks about a series of visions in which he saw them--the Leviathans--as great slumbering giants. As dark, demonic forms floating out in space ... waiting. Waiting for something to wake them."

"Do you buy that? What does it have to do with the crew?"

"I don't know if I believe it, necessarily--I mean ... visions? not scientifically verifiable, to say the least--but his point is ... now, in the updated version ... maybe there never was a crew. Maybe it's just *one living thing.* 
"Like a giant evil space-whale? You're such a *nerd!*" she says. "But you are really cute. You busy tonight?"

Cuchulain coughs on his coffee. His face is hot enough to scald milk.

"Well?" she asks.

"I'm doing the night shift at the research center, but ..."

"What do you do?"

"Astronomical analysis."

"Sounds important," she says. "You must be a busy man."

<!-- BACK AT THE LAB -->

"Not really. It's pretty slow here at night. Mostly I just read," Cuchulain says. "But this is where all the magic happens. All I've really gotta do it keep an eye on this baby," he waves his copy of *Sleeping Gods* at a dot-matrix teleprinter that occasionally buzz-saws a line of data onto a perforated scroll of paper, "... watch the NEO feed come in. Check it every hour or so. That's the ... amalgamated data from five major observatories. Sky watch. Just ah ... ah ... looking out for. For um ... anything new. Heading toward Earth ..."

<!-- TODO: she's doing something Cuchulain finds quite distracting. Taking off her sweater, making eyes at him -->

"You're close enough to touch it," she says.

"The Avalon? Yeah. I've been inside it, even. There's an access over there," he points out the window to a tented structure.

"Take me?" she says.

"How old are you?" He asks.

"I already told you, I'm nineteen."

"Bullshit," says Cuchulain.

"What do you care?" She steps closer and puts her hand on his chest. There's a scent coming off of her, sweet and spicy and intoxicating. Something like jasmine and cardamom and the salt spray of the ocean. Her hair is long and black and it shines with blue streaks and her eyes are sharp and hungry. "I want to take you inside," she says. "Don't you want to come?"

He does. Oh yes, he does. 

"What's your name?" he asks.

She tells him, "Morgaise," and she takes his hand and pulls him toward the tented access passage.

"I can't take you on board," he says.

She laughs. "You can't stop me," she says.

He pulls back against her--or rather, he intends to--but finds he can do no more than caress her wrist with a little, barely-voluntary movement of his hand.

"Really," he says. "We shouldn't."

"You just want me to *make* you come, don't you?" she says as she leads him through the temprary structure and onto the huge alien ship.

Cuchulain is torn between the creeping guilt crawling up from his gut, and another feeling sizzling away a little lower. 

"Morgaise," he whispers to himself, feeling the name fill his mouth, thinking a little less now of the way her ass looks under her tight black skirt, thinking a little less of the way her ass feels when the back of his hand, guided by her own, brushes against the taut black fabric.

They are in a magnificent open chamber now. There are large smooth surfaces--windows or viewscreens along one side of the chamber shine and gleam softly, though they show only darkness. A massive tree--though it can't be a tree, certainly--comes up through the floor as if rising from a pond. It's trunk is only partially visible along the opposite wall. A vast, gnarled semicircle cut with a wide, flat table and stretching upward, pushing out and in and up and branching off high overhead before continuing up into and through and beyond the ceiling.

Cuchulain has never seen this place before. He's come inside before and wandered through the halls, but it's always been rather disorienting and he's never round any place like this.

The girl runs her hands over instrument panels, over the gnarly surface of the strange bark-like material. Her touch lingers on an odd protrusion--something like the hilt of a sword, or a control grip, or a knotty outgrowth.

"Don't touch anything," says the Cuchulain, inexplicably breathless.

"Doesn't it feel good to break the rules?" she asks.

It does.

"What do you think will happen when another Leviathan comes?" she asks. 

"The skies have been empty for a long time," he says. 

"But still, you watch," she says. "Every night." 

"Isn't it strange that something so beautiful, so full of wonder as the night sky can hold such danger? such deadly secrets hidden in its depths?" he says, looking deeply into her eyes as she leans over him, laying him back onto the table at the base of the tree.

"I don't think it's strange at all," she says as she slides the razor-sharp blade across his neck. "I think it's strange you think you'll be safe here. You think this ... ship ... will protect you? It will not."

As the panic rises in him and the blood gurgles and sputters and the life pours out of him as he sucks down his last choking breaths.

"Don't you get tired of waiting? They'll come if you call," she says. "You just have to know how to ask."

The table beneath Cuchulain begins to glow where his blood splashes onto it. It's an altar, he realizes. A sacrificial altar. The glow spreads in pulsing waves synced in tempo with the violent beating of his heart, with the spurting jets of blood. The tree begins to glow and quiver. The very surface soaks up the blood as it pours from Cuchulain's dying throat. Eventually the altar swallows his body entirely. Tendrils of energy pulse through the tree and into the superstructure. 

Morgaise pulls a dark, swirling orb from within her purse and stares into it. She utters some deep, throaty incantations. She manipulates the strange handle protruding from the trunk of the tree.

Synaptic pathways of the great Leviathan crackle to life and high above, somewhere along the outer hull, a transmitting beacon comes to life and turns to the heavens. It generates a looping, repeating pattern of data. It fires out a call, a summons aimed out into the unknown depths of the great beyond, where the signal is picked up by other Leviathans, the Ancient Ones, who begin to tremble in response. They begin to tremble and stir from their slumber, and one by one they turn their noses toward the source of the signal and accelerate, pushing themselves out of their long eliptical orbits for the first time in millenia as they move with deadly intention toward Earth.
