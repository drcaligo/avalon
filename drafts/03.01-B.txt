<!-- ACT THREE: Mabby finds the kid she raced earlier. The kid thinks he's better on the machines than her, and he's looking for a rematch.; Just when she's starting to forget about all that other shit and enjoy herself, something terrible happens.; The kid gets killed for going overboard trying to prove that he is better than her. If she hadn't of put him in his place and embarrassed him in front of all his friends, he wouldn't have taken such drastic measures, and maybe would have survived.  -->

<!-- TODO: figure out what the hell happens to get the Kid killed -->
