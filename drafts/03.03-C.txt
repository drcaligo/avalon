# Karl Faces the music

<!-- ACT THREE: Morgaise and Karl watch (Karl in horror) as attacks begin. The Camelot folds, annihilating the city. -->

---

Karl worries about what will happen to his carreer if anyone finds out that he is responsible for calling down a disaster like this. Already under investigation, as artifacts/equipment under his supervision have been stolen and are appearing on the black market.

Morgaise tells him to forget about it

She tells him it is inevitable. He should let go of his fear and give himself over to the void.

They watch the news. Panicked broadcasts. The earth rumbles. Energy weapon strikes from space.

Everything goes white.
