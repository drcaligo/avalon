<!-- ACT THREE: Crisis on the bridge. Mathuin draws the sword. Ship folds to the outer Solar system -->

Carroll is losing his grip. He doesn't sleep. He refuses to leave the ship. He doesn't cooperate with medical examiners. there is some question of replacing him before the mission launch. Other officers have been discussing his state of mind, and plan to request action from high command.

He demands that Merlaine bring him, immediately. Just to talk. Merlaine has already made moves to bring the kid. He knows that something must happen here. Carroll makes a progressively worsening scene. He invites Mathuin to stay with him ... he makes sweet, drunken promises, but Mathuin hears voices all around him. Voices of the trees, the voice of the Camelot Tree - the Branstock - they see through Carroll's lies, and Mathuin calls him on his lies. He sees through his father, he sees the terrible sins he has committed and he provokes him, they escalate toward violence (Carroll knows he cannot die so long as the earth is beneath them) and into violence. And when Mathuin draws the great sword Excalibur (or Gram - or Wrath) the ship comes to life and they Fold space into the outer reaches of the solar system, dragging the majority of the city of Odessa / Avalon with them. Now Carrol begins to panic, for he knows the prophecy is about to be fulfilled. 

The ship lights up. Systems come on line that have never been on line -- so long as any here have been present. The entire ship seems to respond to Mathuin, anticipating his every move. He reaches toward a handle and draws a massive sword from the console.

Energy courses through him. The ship folds into the outer solar system, drawing much of the city with it. The city no longer has earth beneath it, no longer has sky above it, Carroll realizes, looking out the portal into the blackness of space as the officers stab him to death.
