<!-- ACT FOUR: Lance Elliot has problems with the control of his fighter - the entire squadron has been compromised. They are wiped out in good order, but Lance's expert piloting ability allows him to escape with only moderate damage.  -->

The squadron of fighters deployed from the Camelot gets beat up pretty bad. They don't stand a chance against the shoggoth. 
Lance ELliot, Ace Pilot, gets shot up. He has to miss some of the action. He 'docks' on a large floating chunk of earth to make repairs. 

He finds a crowd of desperate survivors, all clammoring to get aboard his little ship.
