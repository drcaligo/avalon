<!-- ACT FOUR: The Camelot crew is caught off guard. They scramble to rescue survivors and bring them aboard, while they are struck by a Shoggoth attack. -->

The crew is caught off guard. Nothing like this was supposed to happen, let alone even be possible. They spot the remnants of the city floating outside the ship and scramble to save what they can once they realize there is still an atmosphere out there. 
Mathuin starts speaking in weird tongues. states that the space fold system is maintaining a super-dimensional pocket around them. he will do what he can to hold the pocket, but ship power is low, having not been exposed to raw solar radiation for some time. 
They open the cargo bays and deploy what work crews are available to collect survivors.
A scout patrol from the Old Ones folds into the area and attacks them. 
The Old Ones are able to penetrate the Interdimensional Pocket without trouble, but the Camelot crew isn't able to send out any ordinance. they are helpless while they are running the rescue effort.
They scramble and direct gravity manipulation beams onto the wreckage, forcibly collecting neighborhoods that are in (relatively) good shape other than losing gravity. there are fires and other traumas. The collection process causes much damage, but gives at least some chance for the civilians to survive.
Shoggoth fighters get inside the ship and attack the survivors and cleanup crews.
