<!-- ACT ONE: Mabby's a vaudeville performer. Her troupe has set up in the shadow of Camelot to capitalize on the celebrations. She is good with machines. But she doesn't get along with Tyler; She moves around a lot, feels like when she gets to like something, it gets taken away; Some kid brags at the show, she catcalls him, lures him into a race or competition. -->

## almost late for the show

Mabby shows up with no time to spare before showtime. Osgar scolds her for being late. "I'm here, aren't I?" she says. "Why don't you get off my back?"

Osgar scolds her for mistreating her machine. "Yes, I'll shout at you if you take the damn thing out for joyrides, because it needs maintenance. But fucking tell me, so I can do the work. Your're putting your own life in danger. But not only your own, but Tyler's life too. Your chain is worn thin. If you blew that in the cage, it could have killed either one of you. Both of you. Don't just stare at me like you don't give a fuck. It's one thing to take a scolding from an old man, it's another to be dead. You might be stupid, but I never took you for a coward. Or a killer.

The performance goes well. The crowd loves it. There is some little tension between Mabby and Tyler. Trying to prove who is better. After the show, he says something to her that catches her off guard. The show went great. She is elated. He criticizes her, when she is expecting praise.
