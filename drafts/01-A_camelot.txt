# The Avalon Project

## 1.01

"Have you seen her yet?" asks the driver, studying Commander Aemond Carrol's face in his rear-view mirror. "Sir?"

"Only in the screens and on paper," Carroll says, leaning back into the dark leather, pulling his hat lower over his eyes.

"She's big, sir." the driver says, widening his eyes as if to give emphasis.

"Over a thousand meters," Carroll says. "I've read the reports."

"Numbers is numbers. We've all seen her in the videos and looked at the pictures and read the figures, but until you stand in her shadow and look at her with your own eyes, it doesn't mean anything, Sir. She's *big.*"

"You think she'll fly?"

"Yes, sir. That's what they say. And you know what else they say? They say she's *bigger* on the inside. You believe that?"

"I don't know what to believe anymore, son." He has read the reports, but he isn't about to substantiate rumors. The volume discrepancy is classified information. Is this the kind of show they've been running here? Loose lips sink ships, as the old addage goes.

Carroll closes his eyes for a moment. It's been a long day. "How far now?" he asks."

"40 minutes, sir." The motorcade is proceeding smoothly, if a little slowly. "The city is overflowing with visitors. They've come from all over the country--and beyond--to see the launch."

Carroll hears another voice. A familiar voice. Coming to him from the empty seat next to him. It asks him a simple question. One that he hears often, but there is no comfort in the familiarity. Carroll's blood runs cold every time that voice puts out even the simplest of syllables.

"Why did you turn your back?" asks the voice.

"This again? You've been dead for years, Blanquo. When are you going to find something better to do with your time?"

The driver glances back and forth from the road to Aemond Carroll's face. "I'm sorry, sir," he says. "What was that?"

"Nothing. It's just ... It's been a long day. I'm going to close the divider and take a little shut-eye."

"Yes, sir. Of course, sir," the driver says as Carroll raises the tinted divider between them. 

Carroll removes a glass from the built-in cabinet and helps himself to a golden pour of whiskey. "I'd offer you some, but ... you know ..." Carroll says to the empty air.

"You made promises," says Blanquo's ghost. "You made promises and you broke them. You abandoned her like a coward."

"This again? I couldn't know she would take it so hard, losing you." Carroll tilts back his glass and empties it down his throat. "Perhaps I should have been there for her. Perhaps I could have talked with her more. She was your wife, my friend. Of course it was hard for her. It was hard for me too. It was hard for us both ... it was a dark time ... I do not remember much of it. She took her life. At least you are together. I miss you, friend. But still ... I do wish you'd stop visiting me like this. Whatever you are. Ghost or fantasy or indigestion." 

Blanquo laughs. It is not a soothing laugh. "I'll never tire of you Aemond. My *friend.* Not until you are dead."

"What do you want, Blanquo? Are you here to bring more visions? A heart attack? An epileptic fit? Or are you finally come to call me home? Eh? Blanquo?" 

Blanquo doesn't speak. He instead points out the window. They are driving past a sacred grove -- a stand of trees, and at its center, a towering oak.

<!-- TODO: Carroll sees a sacred grove on the way to Avalon - sees it out the window. He must later ask about it, and discover there is no such grove. Only a small stand of Alders on base, at the chapel. -->

> Carroll stands at the foot of the giant oak. 

> A strange, gnarly root structure has the appearance of an altar. The hilt of a great sword protrudes from the twisted layers of bark.

> "What happened to the day?" he thinks. "Where did the hours go?" A few soft beams of deepening sunlight cut through the dark grove at a near-horizontal angle, casting their dappled kisses onto the water of a twinkling spring that burbles and splashes, cascading down a steep slope of earth and stone into a pool at the base of the great tree. The water shimmers and sends dancing reflections across the wood. 

> Three crooked and cloaked women emerge from the shadows, rising up from the pool.

> "Feed the roots and fill the pool," they speak with the voices of small children. "Hail to the father of the king." The three women scrape and bow and reach toward the two men with outstretched crooked claw-like fingers. 

> "Kingfather, Fear nothing until Birnam wood come to Avalon," says the other. "Until your own son pulls the great blade from the spine of worlds."

> "I have no son." 

> "Mark these words. You will clear the path for the salvation of the survivors. And you, great one ... No mans hand shall have the power to stay you. You shall not die, unless it is by the hand of your own son--"

> "By the hand of a King," says another.

> "Far from the soil of earth."

Carrol stirs from his sleep and with shaking hands pours himself another drink and knocks it back. The glass clatters against his teeth. 

He pulls his mobile from his attache case and puts through a call.

"Father Merlaine? Yes, tell him it's Aemond." 

Carroll looks at the bottle, looks around the seating compartment and pours himself one more drink. A small one. The shaking in his hands is beginning to subside.

"Father?" he says. "Yes, I know. Can you meet with me? After the ceremony would be fine. Of course. Yes, its about the dreams. The dreams are getting worse."

## 1.02

<!-- ACT ONE: They arrive on site. Carroll walks through certain areas that have been opened up to the press. They ask him questions about his assignment. -->

Carroll is asleep when the come into sight of her. The driver tries to wake him up.

"Commander Carroll," he says. "Excuse me, Sir, but I thought you might like to see this."

Aemond doesn't want to take a look at it. It's not that he doesn't want to see it, or that he doesn't care, it's just that he has finally drifted into a well-deserved and long-craved-for dreamless sleep.

He opens his mouth to reprimand the <!-- young guard . an inferior officer from a seperate branch of military - Carroll is Navy, this kid is more like Special Services --> driver, but his breath falls away before he can formulate a phrase. It's midday now, and they are crossing over the rim of the Avalon Crater. There's a strange grey-green mist clinging to the crest of the last rise.

<!-- TODO: maximise the effectiveness of this passage - the first sighting of the Avalon perhaps I should find some comparable passage of awe ... some extant literary example -->

When they crest the last rise, the felled leviathan fills Aemond Carroll's field of vision completely. It looms powerful and strange and more than mountainous - she's a great deep green backdrop cutting off the sky. 

Once they drop down into the valley and penetrate that first layer of mist, she's everywhere. In every direction, she vanishes into the light haze. 

"How far?" Carroll begins to ask.

"Two kilometers of road to the valley floor ..." 

## 1.03 press tent

Aemond Carrol waves to the cameras. His escort encourages him to smile, so he tries it. He gives a stern smile to the press corps and blinks tiredly against the flashing lights.

Waiting to take the podium, Carroll seeks refreshmentts in the press tent.

He leans on the bar and says "scotch" to the keeper, who replies with some artificial, over-familiar greeting that Carroll completely ignores. He acknowledges it only by repeating the word "scotch."

<!-- TODO: Blanquo says something -->

Carroll tries to chase Blanquo away with a single malt scotch. That doesn't work, so he tries a shot of cheap blended whiskey instead. Blanquo seems confused and backs off for a while, but then he comes back even bolder, if a little less steady on his feet. Aemond knocks back another shot of whiskey, and Blanquo fades away, but not for long. He comes back, pointing his knobby finger at Aemond. "Why?" he asks. "Why did you do do it?"

Blanquo always liked tequilla. Aemond buys a round of tequilla shots for a group of young uniformed ladies. 

The girls are giggly and impressed. They whisper to each other and make doe eyes at Carroll, whos attention is focused on the screen.

   > An announcer talks "... A great ship to rival (and perhaps to protect earth from the influence of) the terrible Leviathans that cross the heavens (and - sometimes - dip into the upper atmosphere) every 75 or 100 years, bringing strife and terror and nightmares and unrest and upheaval to all the peoples of the earth when they come.

   > The announcer interviews Chief Science Officer Eioan Boyd.

Blanquo shuts up for a while. He slides on down to the end of the bar

   > We were dying to find out whether the Leviathans are really giant organisms--the great beasts of the outer world our traditions have left us with--or whether they are actually interstellar (or at least interplanetary) craft *designed* to carry cargo and passenges. This had been the popular emerging view, as I'm sure you are aware.

<!-- CHARACTER: TV talkshow personality -->

   > There has been much debate over the nature of the Leviathan now dubbed Avalon. Questions about its fundamental nature. Here's the basic question: Is she a ship, or a living organism?

   > That's just it ... I mean ... we haven't really come to a consensus. We've lived with the Leviathans for generations--

   > Is that correct? Leviathan*s*? Leviathan? Leviathon? Leviathi?

   > Leviathans. We've always had them. The great beasts of the outer world, of the heavens. They periodically come close to earth, visiting the outer atmosphere, entering into the Earth's biosphere, bringing terror and dark visions to the earth's population. Every 70-odd years or so, we are swept by terrifying, yet strangely coherent visions - everyone has the same nightmare, night after night. Violent incidents spike. Hospitalization, incarceration, madness. All of these things are violently magnified and influenced. Right? And to think that this might be a *ship.* But the interesting thing is ... we still don't know, exactly. There are similarities to each model. In some ways, the Avalon behaves as a living organism, but she has centralized control interfaces and areas that seem to be designed for crew and passengers.


Blanquo's still there, sitting at the end of the bar with a beer in front of him, watching Carroll with his bloodshot eyes.

Damn distracting, that. 

   > The more we studied and entered into the process, the more we have discovered ways to interface with the guiding systems - the nervous system of the thing. But it is like a beached whale. It is dying here. There may be something it needed in the atmosphere, but without the raw radiation of unprotected space, the systems are failing.

   > The ship certainly has certain things in common with an organism. It has provisions for things that could be considered sub-organisms. like blood-cells or bacterial cultures ... a living system that makes up a larger living organism. Perhaps something like a hive populated by bees or wasps. 

   > Some of the more interesting things is the presence of housing areas--substructures that seem capable of supporting the basic needs of significant populations ... and what we are calling Control Quarters. 

   > The Control Quarters are like nothing we've seen or imagined before. They appear to be bio-chemical interfaces into the main systems of the ship. Nothing like the computer-controlled interfaces and operating systems we are used to. These Control Quarters seem to operate through a direct connection to the nervous system

   > Our research has been inconclusive. Results come down on either side of the matter, but with leanings toward the ship as a living system. It is slowly draining of power. Power that keeps the self-maintaining properties of the thing operational. If it is a machine, we should be able to re-power these systems even after they wind down and expire. But we have been unable to discover anything that might allow us to re-power anything here. 

   > But so what?

   > Among other things, there is the question of crew. If the thing is inanimate, if she's a ship, a piece of technology, it should be a relatively simple thing to put a crew in there, but if she's a living system, she might have ... resistances. An immune system. It might be like trying to transplant an organ. Or a blood transfusion. Who knows if we are the right blood type, even?

Carroll stalks down to the end of the bar and leans in to Blanquo's ear. "I've had about enough," he says. "It's time for you to take your filthy eyes off me and leave me alone. Get the fuck out of here, dead-eyes."

Carroll picks up the remainder of Blanquo's beer and pours it easily down his throat. He sets the empty glass back onto the bar with a thump and aims a long hissing breath at the girls, pushing it out through his widest, most lecherous grin.

"What do you think he said to him?" the girls are huddled a little closer together now, their giggles pitched a little higher, a little more nervous. "Shouldn't you go after him?" "Why? He's not *my* boyfriend."Well, you certainly lead him on." "My my ... are we jealous? You can have him, if he means so much to you ..."

<!-- polish -->

That wasn't Blanquo at all. Carroll just threatened some kid. Some innocent kid. 

Carroll is losing his mind.

He can feel the kid slinking away behind him, with his tail tucked between his legs. there'd been someone else behind Blanquo's face. someone real. he didn't think that had ever happened before. No matter. the kid was a coward. no man worth his salt would walk away from his womenfolk like that. Waste of fertilizer.

"How's that temper, Aemond?" Blanquo asks from across the bar. "Got it under control? You always were a mean drunk."

> The more we studied and entered into the process, the more we have discovered ways to interface with the guiding systems - the nervous system of the thing. But it is like a beached whale. It is dying here. There may be something it needed in the atmosphere, but without the raw radiation of unprotected space, the systems are failing.

"There's your man now," says an unwelcome voice. Blanquo nods his smashed face up toward the video screen mounted on a telescoping stand above the bar.

<!-- Father Merlaine presents a sacred grove that has been transported from the Druidic capitol for the dedication ceremony - some of the senior most majestic trees of Birnam Wood. This causes some disturbance, as the trees are some of the oldest and most loved. Commentators and all agree that a lesser gesture would have been appropriate, but it just goes to show how much global hope and good will is tied up in the Avalon project -->

> EXT. ODESSA - OUTDOOR STAGE. 

> Father Merlaine speaks into a microphone, addressing a crowd of thousands. The wind blows into the diaphragm of the mic every so often, distorting his words with a powerful dry fluttering. Behind him to either side stand giant digital screens, upon which his own face is displayed, along with subtitles in several languages.

>>> MERLAINE     
It is with great pleasure that I, on behalf of the Druidic Order, present this sacred grove to the city of Odessa, Home of the Avalon Project.

> The giant screens cut to display a freshly transplanted grove. Massive, ancient oaks dwarf a crew of gardeners, and are in turn dwarfed by the the great greenish mass of the Avalon rising up behind them.

>>> MERLAINE    
>>> (voice over)    
>> Five of the most ancient trees of Birnam Wood, the Order's most revered garden.

<!-- NOTE: a class of gardeners to tend the sacred groves - this could be fleshed out. -->

> A murmer runs through the crowd. There is much agitation and surprise rising from the audience.

> Merlaine's presentation--on the television, at least--is interrupted by the commentators.

>>> CONAN    
>> Am I seeing this right, Marty?

>>> MARTY    
>> This is certainly a surprise, Conan. Hold on ... the press release doesn't say anything about Birnam Wood ... there it is. A grove of saplings, it says, grown from cuttings from gardens established in each colony will be presented as a gesture of hope and peace. 

>>> CONAN
>> This is an extravagant surprise. What a gesture of goodwill and faith by one of the Holy Order's most re--

Carroll turns toward the group of girls. "Birnam Wood, did he say?"

"Are you a religious man?" "Yes. That's what he said. Isn't that something?" "Have you ever been to one of the Prime Groves?" "Those trees are thousands of years old." "Can you imagine the things they've seen?"

The girls chatter on and on, but they fade out of of clarity in Carroll's awareness as Blanquo slides between Carrol and the ladies. He leans easily on the bar and begins to speak.

"That priest Merlaine can manipulate your mind only so much ... you think you can escape the consequences of your actions just because you have him wipe you clean of sin? You think that's all it takes?" 

Carroll tries to ignore the lurking corpse. He tries to look past him, to look through him, to see the gleaming beauties beyond, but his vision is cloudy. Something stuck in his eyes, perhaps. The rheumy film of sleep. He tries to wipe a way the glaze of obfuscation, but it does no good. He tries to listen, to focus his ears instead, but a ringing sound swims into his awareness and washes over him like a gentle wave. It builds in volume and intensity and color until nothing else is left. He is engulfed in a roaring whiteout.

---

Carroll takes the podium.

Someone asks him a question and Carroll asks him to repeat it, because what he heard was "Why did you abandon her? If you loved her enough to kill me, you should have taken care of her. Why did you leave her alone, after you had taken everything from her?"

<!-- "I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?"

"There have been rumors that the ship is actually a living organism. Can you comment about the validity of such claims?"

"I've only just arrived, myself," Carroll says. "Back on the mainland, people have been saying all kinds of crazy stuff about the Avalon Project. I'm lucky enough to get a chance to see inside this thing and experience it first hand. So I'm doing my best to avoid those kinds of irrational speculations and reserve judgment until I have some empirical evidence." -->

Carroll is sweating. The lights are bright. He knew the Avalon was big, but the driver was right: the numbers didn't mean anything until you actually saw the thing. It didn't matter what you knew from study, what reports you read. The thing made him nauseous when he looked at it.

"What about the dreams?" asks another journalist.

"Excuse me?" Carroll says.

"Tell me why you did it, Aemond. Tell me why you killed her. Hadn't you done enough?"

"I don't know what you are talking about," Carroll says, quite loudly. Blanquo's ghost is stalking through the press corps, and now blood is dripping from his chin. From his fingers.

"You were awarded command of the CAWDOR some years ago now. You were the youngest captain to be commissioned with command of one of the system-class battleships."

"That's right," Carroll says.

"You lead that ship through many conflicts. Do you think you'll be flying this ship into battle--into an armed conflict--any time soon?"

"I hope not. I certainly hope not."

"Why, then, the sudden move to push the launch date forward? The originally announced launch date is still more than a year away. Why the sudden change?"

"I have not been made aware of any impending military actions. To my knowledge, no immediate threats have been introduced. This is to be a purely scientific mission. Our teams have made great progress in the past years, and they feel it is time to take this project into it's next phase."

"But why the rush? Surely there is still much to be done right here ..."

## 1.04 into the belly of the whale

<!-- Carroll is escorted from public areas into security-clearance required areas. -->

A guard directs Carrol into a private chamber of brushed steel. 

He is alone in the room, but he knows that one wall is a one-way viewer with security officers standing on the other side, watching him. He gives a wry, sardonic salute and removes his boots and his uniform. He folds everything carefully and places it all into the drawer. He slides the drawer into the wall with a click.

The catch clicks again and the drawer pops open. 

A voice comes into the room through a hidden speaker or vibrating panel somewhere.

"Everything, sir."

Carroll looks askance at the view wall.

"Your necklace, sir."

"Of course," Aemond says. He'd forgotten he was wearing it. He reaches to slip the thing over his head, but is heavy and difficult somehow to remove.

"It's hard to let go, isn't it?" Blanquo is leaning against the wall, standing next to the drawer with his arms crossed in front of his chest. His nose is broken and crooked, his face is battered and swollen. His voice is hoarse and occluded. His teeth are broken and his tongue fills his mouth like a meat-stufed sock. "Even when you don't know what you are holding onto."

Where did he get this thing? Aemond can't remember. He holds it by the chain out in front of his face and looks at it. It's a little silver bear, depicted from the side. Simplified into a curve. Almost a crescent moon with the bear's feet at either end. He drops it into the drawer.

---

Carroll is given a crisp, sterile uniform to wear. He is escorted through another set of security gates and walked into the ship proper. Into the Avalon. Science officers that have been stationed here for some time flank him and take turns speaking at him, briefing him on point after point. Carroll struggles to maintain focus, but he is continually distracted by visions of Blanquo's ghost. He's been visited before, but it's never been this bad. He's always gone away after saying a sentence or two. 

It becomes readily apparent that the press conference and public areas have been carefully staged and prepared to appear familiar and ... human. As they walk deeper into the ship, Carroll looses all sense of direction. It is an unusual sensation--one he is not used to. 

The halls are beginning to look very strange. The materials have an organic appearance. somewhere between living flesh and steel and other expected construction materials. It might be the booze, or his hallucinations might be getting worse, but it looks as if things are shifting about and changing when he's not looking directly at them. His peripheral vision is starting to make him nauseous. It's almost as if the ship is alive. As if she is covering their path behind them. As if she is breathing.

They lead him down one shifting corridor and up another until he is dizzy with it. 

Aemond wishes he had brought some sort of beverage with him to smooth the vertiginous travels, though perhaps it is for the best. He keeps an even, steely demeanor, even though the walls are breathing and the floor is heaving--everything not directly in his line of sight shifts and twists subtly, but as soon as he fixes his gaze onto the offending expanse, it settles into concrete solidity and he can see the undulating motion elsewhere, out of the corner of his eye.

Ususally a little sip will dismiss the ghosts and give Aemond a little peace of mind. But now, Aemond has had several strong samplings and still that vindictive ghost hangs around. Isn't so easily deterred, is he?

"By the Groves, how can you tell where we are going? This place is a sapping maze." 

"They tell me you get accustomed to it," says Eioan Boyd, the chief science officer of the Avalon Project. "But it can be quite disorienting at first, I know."

<!-- CHARACTER: Eioan Boyd - science officer -->

"How much further is it?"

"Distances and pathways fluctuate. And though the Avalon is *much* larger on the inside than the out, there's no way to know. But ... each time you make the trip, the distance decreases."

"How is that?"

<!-- TODO: math to find volume of a cave or other unknown internal space -->

"We haven't been able to determine, exacty, sir. Every test we run returns different results. And ... the form keeps shifting. Walls move about. Dead-ends where thouroughfares were just moments before. Main arterial passageways seem to have more stability. The more traffic a hall gets, the less likely it is to divert or collapse. Most of the internal navigation here--this is really how we get around. After a while, you get a sense for what path is more stable. We haven't even really figured out what cues we are going off of, maybe it has something to do with those little peripheral shifts you may be experiencing--the sensation that something is moving at the edge of your vision. I notice you haven't mentioned it. Most people bring it up right away. It is usually quite disorienting. Have you not experienced disorienting visual phenomena? The walls 'breathing' when you aren't looking directly at them?"

Of course, Carroll had been experiencing these disturbances, but he had attributed them to his own condition--whatever that condition might be. He thought they were simply hallucinations. The same thing that caused him to see his dead friend, Blanquo. So he kept them to himself. Instead, he says "Oh good. I was beginning to fear I'd been poisoned."

"Whatever it is, one soon develops a ... navigational sense. And the walls don't bother you quite so much."

---

<!-- Carroll had seen an interview with Eioan Boyd earlier, during the opening ceremonies. -->

<!-- A Leviathan falls from space and several countries join together in alliance to study the thing. To try and figure it out. There is a great, living tree-like structure that runs through the heart of the thing, with something that looks like the handle of a great sword sticking out. None can budge or activate this thing.  -->

"When the Avalon fell, and we got inside, it opened up debate. She's got a centralized nervous structure. Glands. Hormonal secretions to communicate between various internal systems. Digestion is somewhat in question, but she seems to ... the hull has definite photosynthetic qualities. There is, of course, the question of mass. Where did this tremendous mass come from? There is matter in space, but how would she collect and convert it? Does she come from another planet? The atmospheric support systems, the passageways and control interface networks, these make her seem like a ship, and would suggest a terrestrial origin. She has features throughout that are coordinated to support smaller life forms--it's difficult to tell just how these smaller forms are put together, there don't appear to be any of them inside--"

"There don't *appear* to be any?"

"It isn't clear whether the internal atmosphere is supporting external life forms, or whether they are simply sub-components of the Leviathan herself. They might be as blood cells are in the human body. One thing that is clear, sir--and this is why we've pushed up the launch date so suddenly--while some of the low-level, basal systems are still functioning, their activity is decreasing every day. *If* the Avalon is an inanimate ship, we may some day figure out how to restart those systems, but if she is not, if she is a living system ... once the basal functionings cease, it won't matter how much knowledge we have, we won't be able to revive her.

"She's dying like a beached whale, sir.

"If we want to move forward with this project, we need to take her up. We need to take her into space, where she belongs."

"But we don't actually know what's inside her. We don't know if there is anything alive and alien inside of her. We don't know if *she's* alive. We don't even know how big she is. And you want me to take her up. We're risking a lot more than the lives of a crew."

"That's exactly right sir. But it's our belief, and the belief of the council, that the risk is worth taking."
