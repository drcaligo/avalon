<!-- ACT TWO: Gunnar escapes, but the guards react violently, and Gunnar kills the nurse in order to make his escape-->


Takes it a little bit further. He makes it out to the yard. Showdown at the gate. Armed guards stand by as he threatens to kill the nurse, pressing the splinter of wood deeper into his neck.

He gets out of the gate and into the city, but not without bloodshed. Either the armed guards open fire on him, and he uses the nurse as a human shield and is only able to survive because of it. Or and no --

they come after him with hounds, with tracking dogs. Gunnar stabs the nurse in the neck, killing him, getting blood everywhere, but not on himself.

This doesn't work to dissuade the dogs. Gunnar squats down to take a shit. The dogs get to the shit and go no further. They wail and howl and yammer as Gunnar gets away.

<!-- RESEARCH: if you are being chased by dogs, and you take a shit, will the dogs go no further than your shit? -->
