## Morgaise visits the Sanitarium

<!-- ACT ONE: Morgaise visits Mathuin in the Sanitarium. She kills an orderly in order to have time alone with Math. She takes his seed, just in case something happens to Mathuin - she knows that his blood is important -->

Morgaise pays a visit to the Sanitarium. She brings flowers and comic books and nice enjoyable things. 

She gives some sweets to the orderly, who recognizes her and gives her friendly greeting. (she's been volunteering here for a little while)

"Julie, you've been doing such a great job here," the orderly tells her. "I don't know what these kids would do without volunteers like you. I hope you decide to stick around. Perhaps we could even get you a paid position here."

She enters a padded cell. Mathuin is strapped to a gurney. She brings a little folding table in with her. Sets it up. Puts a vase with a flower arrangement on the table. A stack of comic books.

"I brought you something, Mathuin," she says.

She sets a dimly green-glowing, swirling orb on the little table. She takes off her panties, pulling them down from under her short dress and kicking them over her heels, she puts them on the table.

<!-- The Orb is a Quantum-Entangled Interface, a Q-EI, a Q-eye, or just 'eye' - a superluminal (faster than light) communicator she acquired some time before ... fell to earth in a meteor shower -->

Outside the room. The orderly is foaming at the mouth, going into quiet convulsions, a half-eaten sweet in his hand.

---

On her way out, she looks at the steaming corpse of the orderly.

"I'm sorry," she says. "But you were already dead. You just didn't know it yet."
