<!-- ACT FIVE: Some Shoggoth invaders make their way inside the Camelot. Tyler puts Mabby in a machine, and with the help of Gunnar, is able to defeat the Shoggoth. They become heroes of a sort. -->

A small patrol of Old Ones engages the Camelot. Several Shoggoth units get inside and begin wiping out any struggling civilian survivors they can find in the wreckage. 

Mabby gets inside the new Parzifal and engages the Shoggoth. She is able to distract them and draw them away from the impromptu hospital that has been set up, but they keep hitting her with energy weapons and projectiles. little missile / grenades.

Percy works wonders as a spotter / navigator, pointing out avenues of approach and withdrawal and opportunities for evasive actions. They manage to cripple one of the units--it collapses into the rubble.

But they are cornered and running out of options, the new Tank is damaged severely, and the shoggoth are closing in on the hospital. 

When it looks like all may be lost, Gunnar climbs onto a sagging roof carrying a power-pack and the PHASE LANCE. He hurls a charge, draining the power-pack and destroying the remaining Shoggoth units -- vaporizing them while causing minimal collatoral damage (though he is burnt quite badly and collapses into unconsciousness).

Tyler decides to redesign the tank and install the PHASE LANCE package
