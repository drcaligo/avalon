## Morgaise's Confession

<!-- ACT TWO: Morgaise tells Science Officer Karl Orn that she has used him to summon the Old Ones -->

Morgaise is in a 'relationship' with Karl Orn, the main science officer in charge of the Camelot research and development project.

He starts talking to her about their future together, and she scoffs at him. 

Morgaise Points out that things won't go as he's been hoping. "The Old Ones are coming," she says.

"Yes, they are always coming, aren't the? But we'll be ready for them this time," Karl says. "We just need a couple more years ... just *one* more year."

"You don't get it," Morgaise says. "This is different. They aren't coming like they are always coming: in some vague sense of impending threat sometime to wash by in the next quarter-century or so ... they are coming *now.* They are coming *in force.* Because I have asked them to come. I have summoned them, Karl. They are on their way now. Don't you see?" 

Alerts come on the news. Disturbancs in the solar system. The Old Ones are coming -- though they should not be expected for many years. And this looks like more than a tribute envoy.
