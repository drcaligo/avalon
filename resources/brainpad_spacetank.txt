# we get on the ship

I tell you how it goes here. We get on the ship. We get on the fucking ship because we are lucky enough to get picked up by those shitheads. Those fucking jarface motherfucking bitches. It wasn't enough that they came to our town and fucked our women. Stole our girlfriends and fucked our mothers. they had to bring the ship too.

# we eat rice for ever

We're lucky enough to have some rice to eat. They say that they couldn't have known. They say that there is or that there was nothing to be done about it. They didn't know they would summon that kind of force ... it wasn't a fucking mystery. You don't fuck with shit you don't understand. They put the technology back together from the wreckage. They picked up the pieces and put it back together. Stuck it into their idea of an aircraft carrier. They put it into our own ships without understanding it. And they tried to launch it fuck fuck. 

Of course there is nothing to eat but rice. At least there is fucking rice. I love and hate rice now. 

They'd stockpiled it on board the ship. why? I don't know. Preparations for a long voyage. they loaded up the rice, but not the rest of the supplies yet

There are garden decks. Massive garden decks on the ship. and the grains grew. the rice grows up in space. Fucking miracle, if you ask me. If it hadn't been for the rice, we'd all be fucking dead.

We should all be fucking dead.

# got sucked up into the stratosphere

I don't even know how they got us all on board. The whole fucking town yanked right out of the earth. Rock and mud and water and thousands and thousands of souls rooted down on earth one moment, floating out there in space the next. right on the border, right on the verge, right on the fucking edge. What do they call it? The ionosphere. I think that's it. How did they pick us all up, that's what I'd like to know. Did somebody choose who would make it and who wouldn't? My fucking Mom was with me. She came to visit to see the ceremony. to see them launch the ship. 

Poor old thing. Maybe it's for the best. I didn't know how I was going to take care of her anyhow. A poor piece of shit like me. She kept looking to me, expecting me to make something of my bullshit life. Did she really believe? I don't know. She acted like she did though. Poor old bitch. I hate to think about it. I didn't know how I was going to take care of her anyway. I wasn't going to make something of myself. She thought ... it doesn't matter what she thought now. She's gone. She was with me when the ship launched, when it ripped the ground out from underneath us and threw us all up into the fucking ionosphere. But she wasn't with us when they pulled us all onto the ship. However they did it. We kept waiting for the ship to land. kept waiting for those fuckfaces to put us down, to put us back at home so we could see our families again, so we could get back to whatever might be left of our lives. But ... no. There is nothing to go back to, they say now.

# invasion

I kind of wonder about that. I don't know if they'd tell us the truth about this kind of shit or not. But I might have thought they'd have told us that home was there waiting for us. If there was going to be some kind of lie, I would think that was it. I would think they'd try to keep hope alive for us, but ... no. Fuckfaces. It's all gone. At least for now. The earth is still there, but the attack came fast and hard. Whatever they did, whatever they activated when they launched the ship called something down. called something out of the heavens. The old ones. Ancient gods terrible and cold and vast and powerful and inhuman. When the ship launched. 

They should have been more careful. They didn't understand what they were doing. But they didn't want to lose an arms race. They didn't want those poor fuckers on the other side of the ocean to beat us to the punch. 

Poor fuckers never even saw it coming. They might have heard some whispers about our new ship, our big secret project. But they couldn't have known. They couldn't have known about the old ones. they couldn't have known about where the technology came from.

# the crash

The crash ... years ago. The crash made the news. they covered it up pretty good. Called it a meteor. The largest meteor in modern history. the size of a football field. Scientists came in from every corner to study it. to do whatever the fuck they were doing to it. 

Everybody bought the meteor story. thought it was a big stone. Still they were excited. Thought there could be some evidence of life on it. It was so big. Was there water? was there organic matter?

The newsies were busy with it. Press conferences. All very fucking controlled of course. They housed the journalists in a camp. A concentration camp for news reps from all over the world. Spoon fed them shit about findings in the stone. Lies.

All the while, they were working with the technology. Not even fucking studying it carefully, just putting it onboard a new ship. Our big fucking show. Our big ship packed full of technology from the Old Ones. 

We knew something was going on, didn't we? Us locals could tell. Everything was too controlled. To tight. And of course, by the time they announced the ship ... what did they say? built it with ore ... special materials mined from the meteor. stronger than the strongest steel, but lighter than the lightest plastics. But there was more, much more than that.

# notes

Who is who in this thing? for a moment I thought there was noone established yet, but that isn't correct, is it? There is clearly the guy here. I thought I put some notes together, but it seems that I have not done so yet. This guy is uneducated, but perhaps a great mechanic or some shit like that. Chop shops, customization of little hot-rod cars or little flyers or something. racers. There should be a driver / pilot too.

a girl. I am not really thinking clearly about it, but it would be nice ... to ... figure out what is happening and why I am so laggardly

I like the idea of mixed technology. patch bays and midi level stuff integrated with higher tech stuff. That's what the civilian characters have, perhaps, this affinity for technology, but this great hands-on experience with more outdated and physical systems.

And a class divide between the military guys and the civilians. The civilians have these weird outdated technologies ... racers. I like the idea of them racing ... doing shit for fun, to keep interest in something, to keep morale. Eventually they could work to make their racers operate in a vacuum ...

There is some intuitive talent, some inherent sensitivity that allows (and is necessary for) more complete interaction with -- and control over -- the alien technologies. Not many in the Military are gifted in this way (though some are).

The Girl is marvelously gifted in this way.

This phenomenon is a surprise to the Civilians and many of the military folks, but many have been aware of it for some time. There was a special program in the Small Town, a program that recruited and trained people with that requisite psychic or intuitive sensitivity.

There is a priesthood at work here. A church that surreptitiously worships the Old Ones, some faction that was at least marginally aware of the potential for catastrophe that could occur when the ship launched. This sect may have been working behind the scenes to encourage this to happen.

something about the appropriated technology perverts the people who use it. This isn't clear at the time of launch ... the technology is alive in a way unlike anything known on earth. The fighters and (perhaps more so and more importantly) the main navigation systems of the Camelot interface with the nervous system of the pilot, changing them in weird ways
