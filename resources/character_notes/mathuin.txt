# Mathuin

Mathuin is a ward of the state. Troubled and violent. He is being raised in the large state home for wayward youths, but he spends time in and out of the psychiatric care ward.

He has a deep connection to the Trees, the Sacred Groves.

Igraine didn't give him up right away. She tried to keep him. she told him crazy things. She used drugs. She carted him around.

Igraine eventually killed herself - in front of young Mathuin. Who was already disturbed. 

Mathuin enters the orphanage by the time he's six

Mathuin sees Carroll take some action against the grove of trees. He responds out of an impulse to defend the trees -- his only friends -- perhaps this impulse is amplified by the Camelot, by the nature of the space and the circumstance. He reaches for the nearest object at hand, the great sword in the trunk of the tree and he uses it to end Carroll's life.
