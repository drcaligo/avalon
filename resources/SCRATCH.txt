<!-- ACT ONE: Mabby's a vaudeville performer. Her troupe has set up in the shadow of Camelot to capitalize on the celebrations. She is good with machines. But she doesn't get along with Tyler; She moves around a lot, feels like when she gets to like something, it gets taken away; Some kid brags at the show, she catcalls him, lures him into a race or competition. -->

She's tired of moving around all the time. She doesn't have any family. She's only now getting old enough to really rebel against what she's known. She's known the show for years now. Were her parents in the show? did they die in an accident? she doesn't even know. She could know. how would that make her feel? how would it be to.

Mabby's a bit of a bad-ass and a tomboy. She rides motorbikes, for fuck's sake.

does she fly a gyrocopter? you bet. they do all kinds of arial stunts.

Some kid saw her do an aerial routine in the afternoon, something wih the gyroplane,

# Mabby's plot arc

She is *asleep* to the outside world. She thinks that the circus is her only way - if she plays by the rules, she'll be rewarded. Which is a conundrum and a reversal even in itself, because she thinks of the performance, of the family, the circus, the traveling show as the way to break the rules. Out there? *that's* the sucker's game. Nine-to-Fives and other such bullshits. She looks down on the outsiders and thinks they are fools for playing by the rules, but her own world isn't as free as she thinks. It has just as many rules, only, they are different rules. 

She begins to realize just how stifling this place is.

this is an opportunity for a try-fail cycle or some reversal - She contemplates a departure, but declines it. (oh yeah, refusal of the call) - in this case, the KID (who really needs a name. the Young Master, Mort?) talks to her, tries to convince her to do something else, or at least asks her why she stays with it, if that's how she feels. Why doesn't she pack up and leave - it's funny most parents are afraid their kids will pack up and run off with the circus, and here she is, contemplating packing up and running off with the rest of the world, with the *suckers*.

## how does the circus stifle her?

she thought of the outside world as a world of rules, the circus as a place free of them. But there are just as many rules here.

She thinks that she is exceptional. Special. No other woman could do what she does. She rolls with the tough guys. [this is how she copes with the stiffling atmosphere of the circus]

Every time she makes a friend, finds a cafe she likes to go to, a restaurant she likes to eat at, a place she likes to go ... she has to leave it behind. She instead frequents places here, among the tents and such, among the things they set up each time they arrive somewhere, no matter where they go. The temporary, transient structures they erect each time, creating the same place over and over, carrying their homes upon their backs. She mistrusts these transient locations somhow as dishonest, but they are the best and closest thing to what she's loking for.e

<!-- TODO: five concrete examples of how Mabby's circus life is ruled, regulated and overdisciplined - how it is not free -->

1. Osgar scolds her for mistreating her machine. "Yes, I'll shout at you if you take the damn thing out for joyrides, because it needs maintenance. But fucking tell me, so I can do the work. Your're putting your own life in danger. But not only your own, the lives of your partners too. Your chain is worn thin. If you blew that in the cage, it could have killed either one of you. Both of you. Don't just stare at me like you don't give a fuck. It's one thing to take a scolding from an old man, it's another to be dead. You might be stupid, but I never took you for a coward.
2. Mabby misses mealtime, because she's out galavanting. Cookie scolds her and refuses to feed her. "Slop's all cleaned up now. You wanna eat? Come to dinner at dinnertime, just like everyone else."
3. Mabby snaps at some kid who insults her after her performance. They make her stand by the exit and hi-five and thank everybody for their patronage and support as they depart, and some kid lips off at her in the worst way. Mabby puts him in his place, demeans him and shuts him right up. The MC takes Mabby aside and scolds her
4. Mabby is caught out after curfew. "what the fuck do we even have a curfew for?" she wants to know. Management fines her and revokes her vehicle priveleges (she 'borrows' a bike or gyroplane from the garage anyway, leading to example 1)
5. "We always have to leave. What if I don't want to go?" she asks Kidd. "What if I want to stay?" but she never can. It's always the same thing.  

would these be five consequence / punishment scenarios? I guess I can play around with them a little bit. The idea is not to use all of them in the final cut, but to just feel it out and rangle tangle with the themes, Watch Mabby 
Danger struggle with authority. She has a problem with authority figures, doesn't she?

"You've got a problem with authority figures, don't you?" Osgar asks her, pointing a wrench at her face.

"Is that how you see yourself? As an authority figure?" Mabby laughs. "You're nothing but an old drunk.

how much fucking planning do I need to do? why am I always planning shit? I could consider this writing, but instead, no. I am ... too much just sketching shit out. This sucks. I want to get out of here. I have things to build, things to do. Work and otherwise. Fuck. Grow up already, children.

## what keeps her at the circus?

# Perfect World - Her initial environment

1. Her environment is the traveling show. The Carnival. The Festival. This is a male-dominated world in which she *should* be considered an outsider, but she thinks of herself as *one of the boys,* she is exceptional, she can do what no other woman can do, so she **fits in** here
	1. gyroplane show
	2. globe of death (perhaps with a different name in this one)
	3. the workshop / garage - maintaining the equipment

I thought for a moment of really focusing on the motorbike aspect of this shit. Have them in the workshop all the time, customising and building things - then when they get onto the Avalon, they continue doing the same kind of thing, but just ... to the next level. But motorbikes are solo, small and quick. I am thinking of the tank here - speicfically because of the small team it takes to run it. They are onboard together, with their own jobs, cooperating and collaborating. This could be still the case, even without putting them all in a tank. I think this is part of the fun of the little ship though. Why a tank instead of a fighter? these things are always fighters - aircraft carrier is the traditional analogy, I think. launching bombers and shit like that. There should be different grades or classes of little vessel, from fighters to bombers to yes, tanks. There is something about the homemade guy that works where the others do not. The fighters and shit are compromised. What happens when you fly a plane in a zero-G environment? what happens with a gyrocopter? 

The flying circus - a family affair. They usually are. Her parents ... died in a carnival accident? She doesn't know

Mabby likes to make up stories about her parents. No one wants to talk about them, so she talks to herself about them. makes up stories about how they were killed in a death defying stunt - sometimes she'll tell an audience this right before she attempts the stunt herself - "This is it, folks, the one that killed my parents." But she also likes to think of them as a little more exotic. She sometimes likes to say they were spies in love - they came from two different sides of a conflict and fell so deeply in love together, they had to run away. Mom got knocked up and told Dad she wasn't really who she said she was. Dad wasn't who he said he was either. Mom got a little mad, sure, but they hung out for a little while, just to be safe, just to be sure they hadn't fallen in love with the lies they told each other, but with each other proper instead. And there was nothing to worry about. They were deep deep in love and going to have a baby, so they joined the travelling circus - everything was swell, for about a year, but then Mabby's parents were found. They were located and eliminated, or the went on the run. Too much danger for a little girl, they thought, so they left here here, at the circus. 

"Little did they know, Danger is my middle name. That's right, I have another name. Y'all know me as Mabby Danger, but 'danger' is just the middle. Maybe someday, I'll tell you my full name, but for now, you'll just have to go on knowing me as Mabby Danger."

rehashing some old ground:

the place is hostile to her because she wants freedom, but is surrounded instead by rules and regulations. This might be the way she expresses herself on the surface, but beneath that there is a definite desire to *belong.* She wants to be loved and important and cared for for who she is. There is too much posturing in this place. She has to struggle to hide her inner self, to mask her experience from those around her. She keeps all these secrets--what kind of secrets does she keep? Some girly shit. She loves some girly shit, though she would never admit it. She has a doll hidden away in her bags - a plush unicorn named Siobhan. She takes her out and holds her and talks to her when no one else is around. But now she's getting older. She doesn't do it so much these days. 

And the things we talk about, they aren't what they used to be, are they, girl? I know. I'm sad too. But we can't help it. No sense beating ourselves up about it. Things change, I guess. Sometimes ...

# The Kid

She has an opportunity to depart -- or she is at least confronted with the question here. He wants to know why she stays with the circus, if that's how she feels. He wants to take her away from this - he's just a kid too, do he doesn't have a real home to offer her, or anything, but he doesn't want to let her go. He wants to be able to spend every day with her. They talk about it. She has good reasons for staying behind. She's waiting for her parents, she says. But that's not it, is it Siobhan? No it isn't but what, then? Why doesn't she leave it behind? She can't live out there in the world of marks and suckers. She can't give up the freedom and the superiority of the life she already has. She can't go back to that other shit way of being.

Go back? You've never been there. You've never tried it. You just don't know anything else.

Mabby Danger and the Kidd ride the sphere of doom together. They have ridden for years together. They are coming into their adolescence toghether too. Awakenings are at hand. Strange things are afoot. 

<!-- [2013-08-18 20:14] -->

She tells the Kidd more than she tells anyone else. But she doesn't share Siobhan. That's something just for her. An inner vulnerability that she doesn't want to share with anyone. She's too guarded for that. She's learned to keep her cards close. When people know something about you, a truth about you, they can use it against you. They often do.

> examples of things people have done to use Mabby's secrets against her?

# secrets

1. what are her secrets?
	1. stupid shit like her stuffed animal
	2. first crush - how she feels about anything, really. a crush could do this - some guy finds out how she feels about him, some outsider who was nice to her - he ridiculed her when someone told him, or when she asked him something herself. He said she was like a boy, and no way would he ever be seen playing kissy-face with a carny anyway, especially a tomboy like her. The Kidd lost his shit when he heard this and punched the guy in the face. Big scene. Mabby and the Kidd got in trouble. Kidd thinks its a perfect example of why outsiders suck, Mabby thinks its a perfect example of how their life here sucks.
	3. her dreams about her parents? she tells people those stories all the time. But maybe she tells them with such exaggerated flourishes and variations because she doesn't want anyone to know that she really believes that shit herself--at least some version of it. - thats where some of these kids can really get her. They tell her "your mother was a whore," and shit like that. "She abandoned you here because she didn't love you. She was a worthless piece of shit, just like you.
	4. something about her relationship with machines. She doesn't want to tell anyone about it, how it really feels, but 

when she is in the cage, or up in one of the gyroplanes, weird shit happens. Not super-weird, but weird enough. she feels like she is connected. Not just to the machine, to everything. But, yeah, to the machine too. The bike becomes an extension of her. She can feel the wheels heating up as they go over the metal mesh, she can feel the mesh as if it were her skin, the pressure like pressure on her - she can see or feel the other rider - the Kidd. She can reach out and touch him at any time. They do a hi-five while no-handsing around the loop. He doesn't know how the do it. He just puts his hand up, and she smacks it. They reach out and hold hands in the middle of the space between them. Their grip forms the center of a universe. everything revolves around their hands, holding each other in the middle of the roaring machines and steel and chaos and the blasting music and the roaring of the crowd and all the pain and loneliness and longing and *shit,* all of it just melts away. It doesn't fucking matter, so long as they are holding on. It's a point, a point in the middle of of everything, one fixed moment, that contact. It is outside of her, but inside her too ...

<!-- [2013-08-19 09:00] -->
There's always people trying to dig at these moments, trying to take them away from her. To make her share them, to make her open up, to talk about them. "It'll be good for you," they say. "You need to talk to someone, but she doesn't need that. She needs to protect herself.

It's hard. She wishes she could be like Kidd. She pretends to. He's tough. He's happy with what he's got. He doesn't long for something different. He belongs to the circus and that's enough for him. Why isn't it enough for Mabby? Why does she always get attached to the places they visit? the people she meets? why does she want something else, a different kind of life? She can't help it. She can't ...

Right. This is a fucking tangle. I forgot all about that. I knew I had work to do, but I didn't remember exactly where I was at with it all.

---

Exercise - establish this place more concretely. Five individual places within it, or five things she'd do in her normal day. What's a normal day look like for her?

* wing-walking / gyroplane show. definitely need to figure this bit out a bit
* motorcycle cage routine 

those are her two main acts, I think. She often performs the gyroplane thing in the daytime, the cage thing at night, or when the weather is bad, or if for whatever reason there is restriction on airspace--usually only terrible weather or darkness prevent the airshow from taking place.

# sphere of death

She was one of the youngest people to ever ride in the sphere of death.

--- 

oh shit--what if they had an orrery? an orrery of death. The orrery of death. each ball moving on its own, yet connected to all the other balls, swinging in wide arcs 

Fuck the orrery of death. Who needs that thing. 

She did the sphere of death when she was young. quite young.

And it seemed it would be exciting, but there was a lot of standing around and shaking peoples hands or giving them hi-fives while they filed out, shuffling their feet, all the while, 'high-intensity' rock music was playing over the P.A. - can you feel it? the heat is on. Burnin' this place to the ground, and all the while she's full of smiles and touching peoples hands who tell her "Nice work, kid." or "Good job," all of it nice, really, but all of it she'd heard before, over and over, and it was so empty. so much empty time, so little action. It's all travel days and shaking hands and trying to keep an excited face on and looking like she's having a great time while other people get drunk, and she's just got to wait and to wait and to wait until finally she can go and do her thing, and it's over. Like that it's over, each time so fast. Sometimes she gets into the zone and disappears. She disappears and she doesn't even know where she goes. Just into her head somewhere, she guesses. She just goes into her head, and the show seems a blank spot in her. She wakes up and it's all over. She's been waiting for hours for something to happen. anything. And there it is--there it was--and now it's gone and she didn't even get to savor the moment. 

Maybe she did. She hopes she savored it, She hopes she savored it and enjoyed it more than any of the surrounding moments. She liked to think that those moments, those were the moments she was really *alive.* She hated to think it might actually be the other way 'round.
