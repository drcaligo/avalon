A PLOT,"Launch day. The Camelot is about to take a maiden voyage -- an unveiling strictly for publicity purposes. Things go terribly wrong. The government had been incorporating little-understood alien technologies into the ship, and when they launch, The Ship tears the City free from the earth out into the upper atmosphere.

Camelot forces do what they can to bring all survivors onto the ship. They save what they can. 

The launch activates dormant functions of the alien technologies. 

The Old Ones arrive from the great Beyond, presenting a threat the likes of which Earth has never seen.

The earth is bombarded with massive attacks (The Old Ones have Awoken!). What remains of the city of Odessa is taken aboard the Camelot, which has folded space to the outer reaches of the solar system, losing its capacity to fold in the process.

After regrouping, the Camelot sets out to return to earth, where it might be of use in the fight against the Old Ones -- if it can get there in time!
","The Camelot, out on the island of Avalon, is preparing for it's commissioning ceremony.
---
Some PR representative for the Gov't takes press on a very limited tour of the ship.
Avalon is home to cutting-edge research and science. 
The Camelot is touted as a revolutionary breakthrough in space-age technology. More than a kilometer long, with the ability to carry more than five cubic kilometers worth of cargo (Avalon has been--among other things--producing dimension-folding technologies and releasing them into the public sector [though Avalon is a military research and development facility]), the Camelot heralds a brand new era in space travel and exploration. 
The Camelot is being unveiled as part of a 35-year plan. An experimental exploratory mission is being mounted to test gravity drive capabilities with a small crew. They will explore the outer reaches of the solar system, search for harvestable resources and return. 
---
Captain Aemond Carroll is being taken to Camelot. 'Is this your first time seeing it?' one of his companions asks. It is.
---
Carroll walks through certain areas that have been opened up to the press. They ask him questions about his assignment.
due to Carroll's success in a previous military engagement, the admiral has him this command on Camelot. He is a war hero of high order, and this command is a high. Someone mentions Commander Tintagel, who's death (under strange circumstance) paved the way for Carroll's carreer advancement. 
---
Carroll is escorted from public areas into security-clearance required areas. The non-public areas begin to look very strange. The materials have an organic appearance. somewhere between living flesh and steel and other expected construction materials. He is taken to a secret room somewhere in the heart of the ship, where he meets three witches, the only survivors of the crash. They are strange cackling beings that are connected to the ship. He can't tell if they are surgically attached or if they are growing out of the ship's neural network","Carroll accepts the bridge. at the conclusion to the ceremony, he is taken to the heart of the ship to meet the Weird Witches
Merlaine tries to convince Bors to be lenient with Karl",Crisis on the bridge. Mathuin draws the sword. Ship folds to the outer Solar system,"The crew is caught off guard. Nothing like this was supposed to happen, let alone even be possible. They spot the remnants of the city floating outside the ship and scramble to save what they can once they realize there is still an atmosphere out there. 
Mathuin starts speaking in weird tongues. states that the space fold system is maintaining a super-dimensional pocket around them. he will do what he can to hold the pocket, but ship power is low, having not been exposed to raw solar radiation for some time. 
They open the cargo bays and deploy what work crews are available to collect survivors.
A scout patrol from the Old Ones folds into the area and attacks them. 
The Old Ones are able to penetrate the Interdimensional Pocket without trouble, but the Camelot crew isn't able to send out any ordinance. they are helpless while they are running the rescue effort.
They scramble and direct gravity manipulation beams onto the wreckage, forcibly collecting neighborhoods that are in (relatively) good shape other than losing gravity. there are fires and other traumas. The collection process causes much damage, but gives at least some chance for the civilians to survive.
Shoggoth fighters get inside the ship and attack the survivors and cleanup crews.","Fighting dies down. Under control. The ship is stabilized, all remaining civilians and supplies have been brought aboard and the ship is sealed.
Another wave of Old Ones materializes. Earth looks doomed. Appears to be destroyed by the assault. 
Mathuin is able to guide Camelot into another Fold."
B PLOT,"Flight of the Parzifal

Mabby and Tyler go from being at conflict, disagreeable and antagonistic to being thrown in together, the only family either of them has.

Except for Gunnar. He will eventually be kind of like family too. And that other kid, Percy. He'll join them too.","Mabby and some kid hit it off. they flirt and fight and race each other after hours. 

Mabby intentionally throws the race, because she is liking this kid. wants to make something of it.

","Mabby zooms into the no-fly zone, much to Tyler's dismay. Alarms begin to sound. There is a flurry of activity on the ground. Fighters scramble, the Camelot weapon systems come on line. Tyler panics, but it quickly becomes apparent that the Camelot is responding to something else

the kid is over-confident in his own abilities, and he goes out of his way to save her. He doesn't listen when she says 'i'm fine. I got this,' and he gets himself killed.","The Camelot Folds space to the outer solar system, taking much of the city with it.

Mabby and Tyler and their little racer are wrenched out into space. 

The Camelot maintains power to its fold system -- it maintains a pocket of space slightly outside of 'normal' dimensional space, keeping the atmosphere intact.  the crew scrambles to save as many survivors as they can, focusing experimental gravity manipulators to pull people and buildings and everything into the hold.

The little racer is pretty much destroyed, but Mabby and Tyler come out relatively unhurt.

A huge section of the city is floating out in space - miraculously there is air. Tyler and Mabby make their way onto the Camelot"," while many scour the wreckage (now inside the massive interior bay of Camelot) for survivors, Tyler searches for salvagable goods. 

He meets Gunnar, who is doing something similar. Salvaging hardware and strange looking technologies from a ruined lab. A kid (maybe 12), Percy, is hanging around, playing an arcade game console that he's reconnected. he's found a power source -- done some tricky and dangerous rigging to tap into the ship's power grid.

They work together. Gunnar provides much technology and equipment. (Tyler's workshop was outside of the Fold-zone).

They rebuild Gunnar's lab and with equipment from the wreckage, they are able to set up an impressive workshop.

They take the brains of the racer and build a new ship. a little Tank. Tyler doesn't know what else to do. he has access now to equipment that he could never get his hands on back and home, and if he doesn't work on something, he's afraid he'll just crumble into despair and nothingness.

Percy doesn't talk much, but when Gunnar and Tyler are struggling with some coordinates, trying to determine their location by the view of space, Percy rattles of an impressive sequence of mathematical and navigational skill. He's placed them out beyond Pluto, in the outer solar system, in the direction of Leo 

Gunnar wants to install some mysterious hardware, a PHASE LANCE. He and Tyler fight about it. They don't install it","A small patrol of Old Ones engages the Camelot. Several Shoggoth units get inside and begin wiping out any struggling civilian survivors they can find in the wreckage. 

Mabby gets inside the new Parzifal and engages the Shoggoth. She is able to distract them and draw them away from the impromptu hospital that has been set up, but they keep hitting her with energy weapons and projectiles. little missile / grenades.

Percy works wonders as a spotter / navigator, pointing out avenues of approach and withdrawal and opportunities for evasive actions. They manage to cripple one of the units--it collapses into the rubble.

But they are cornered and running out of options, the new Tank is damaged severely, and the shoggoth are closing in on the hospital. 

When it looks like all may be lost, Gunnar climbs onto a sagging roof carrying a power-pack and the PHASE LANCE. He hurls a charge, draining the power-pack and destroying the remaining Shoggoth units -- vaporizing them while causing minimal collatoral damage (though he is burnt quite badly and collapses into unconsciousness).

Tyler decides to redesign the tank and install the PHASE LANCE package"
C PLOT,"Morgaise summons the old ones (at least encourages their arrival) and makes her way onto the Camelot

We follow a man who is manipulated by Morgaise. He is Karl Orn, a brilliant scientist with a large apetite for booze and women. He has been working on the Camelot projet, and Morgaise has slept her way into his good graces and sabotaged much of his work","Morgaise visits the Sanitarium, kills an orderly and rapes Mathuin","Morgaise is involved with a serious sabotage of some sort. something that paves the way for the destruction to come.

She is sleeping with Karl Orn, Science Officer in charge of the Camelot research project. She uses her access to him to perform rituals and activate beacons within the ship that will summon the Old ones.

She confesses to Karl what she has been up to.","Morgaise and Karl, in Karl's lab -- sexy time, but the end is coming, she tells him. He worries about what will happen to his carreer if anyone finds out that he is responsible for calling down a disaster like this.
He worries about his carreer, for the police are questioning him. Investigating a series of crimes. One of the janitorial staff (or perhaps a junior technician), Gunnar, has been stealing equipment to sell on the black market. This is a serious offence. Most of this shit isn't even supposed to exist ...
Morgaise tells him to forget about it
She tells him it is inevitable. He should let go of his fear and give himself over to the void.
The end comes! -- the ship folds, dragging them both with it.","The squadron of fighters deployed from the Camelot gets beat up pretty bad They didn't stand a chance against the shoggoth. 
<!-- The fighters are no good here ... even those designed to fly in vacuum. There's nothing to do but test out the expirimental SpaceTanks. -->

Samfar Stahll, Ace Pilot, gets shot up. He has to miss some of the action. He 'docks' on a large floating chunk of earth to make repairs. 

He finds a crowd of desperate survivors, all clammoring to get aboard his little ship.","Karl and Morgaise manage get on Samfar's crippled fighter. Samfar tells the rest of the folks that he'll be back for them, but just as he's departing, the Camelot directs its gravity beams at all the floating remnants of the city in a desperate attempt to save what can be saved ... the buildings collapse and the people fall screaming toward the Camelot."
a subplot,"#BACKSTORY
# ONE
Carroll talks to his chaplain, merlaine, about dreams of three witches who promise him victory, promotion and success
[universal dreams spreading throughout society]
Carroll victorious.
Carroll pleads with chaplain to assist in his desire to lie with the admiral Tintagel's wife, Igraine.
The chaplain agrees, but demands a great price in exchange.
 Anything,  says Carroll.
---
 # TWO
Carroll, aided by Merlaine's sorcery, kills tintagel and sleeps with Igraine. 
it is commonly believed that Tintagel was killed in a tragic accident -- perhaps even Carroll believes this, having his memory clouded by merlaine's sorcery. 
News of her husband's death shocks and crushes Igraine. She sends Carroll away and says she wants nothing to do with him ever again.
--- # THREE

Years later, Carroll's second, Blanquo -- an old friend and companion who has fought in many battles beside him -- makes some comment about Igraine and Tintagel -- Igraine was consumed by guilt and commited suicide within a year of her husband's death ... He accuses Carroll of some impopriety. Doesn't he feel some responsibility? They fight and Carroll kills Blanquo in a rage.
","Aemond Carroll is being honored at a high banquet. He's being awarded a command of great prestige, but he is feeling dark and uncomfortable. He is visited by the ghost of Blanquo. He has terrible visions, while an announcement is made about his being awarded command of the new and expirimental Camelot.
--- ","# FOUR
In the Ship, Carroll is confronted by the Weird Sisters. He has dreamed of this.
They give him misleading prophecy. False sense of security.--
        you will be in power, and you shall not be killed so long as there is earth beneath this city, and sky over it's head. But your son will be king.
Son? I have no son.
You have. Ask the priest, say the sisters. 
---
Carroll confronts Merlaine. 
Where is he? Carroll demands. My son. Bring him to me. ","# FIVE
Carroll is losing his grip. He doesn't sleep. He refuses to leave the ship. He doesn't cooperate with medical examiners. there is some question of replacing him before the mission launch. Other officers have been discussing his state of mind, and plan to request action from high command.
Merlaine comes sweeping onto the bridge with an autistic child in tow.
What's this? Carroll demands.
Your son.
No son of mine, Carroll says. He threatens violence, foams at the mouth.
He rages powerfully. Is delusional. Officers try to hold him down. He shouts praises to the Old Ones.
Mathuin Dove (dove being a state-given name issued to many orphans) moves to the center console of the bridge. 
The thing lights up. Systems come on line that have never been on line -- so long as any here have been present. The entire ship seems to respond to Mathuin, anticipating his every move. He reaches toward a handle and draws a massive sword from the console.
Energy courses through him. The ship folds into the outer solar system, drawing much of the city with it. The city no longer has earth beneath it, no longer has sky above it, Carroll realizes, looking out the portal into the blackness of space as the officers stab him to death.",,
