summary,"Morgaise summons the old ones (at least encourages their arrival) and makes her way onto the Camelot

ACT ONE,"Morgaise visits the Sanitarium, kills an orderly and rapes Mathuin"
ACT TWO,"Morgaise is involved with a serious sabotage of some sort. something that paves the way for the destruction to come.

ACT THREE,"Morgaise and Karl, in Karl's lab -- sexy time, but the end is coming, she tells him. He worries about what will happen to his carreer if anyone finds out that he is responsible for calling down a disaster like this.
He worries about his carreer, for the police are questioning him. Investigating a series of crimes. One of the janitorial staff (or perhaps a junior technician), Gunnar, has been stealing equipment to sell on the black market. This is a serious offence. Most of this shit isn't even supposed to exist ...
Morgaise tells him to forget about it
She tells him it is inevitable. He should let go of his fear and give himself over to the void.
The end comes! -- the ship folds, dragging them both with it."
ACT FOUR,"The squadron of fighters deployed from the Camelot gets beat up pretty bad They didn't stand a chance against the shoggoth.

He finds a crowd of desperate survivors, all clammoring to get aboard his little ship."
ACT FIVE,"Karl and Morgaise manage get on Samfar's crippled fighter. Samfar tells the rest of the folks that he'll be back for them, but just as he's departing, the Camelot directs its gravity beams at all the floating remnants of the city in a desperate attempt to save what can be saved ... the buildings collapse and the people fall screaming toward the Camelot."
