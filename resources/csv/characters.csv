Gunnar ?,"escaped medical test subject. The Ship operates by means of strange hormonal excretions, some of which have psychedelic porperties when administered to humans - there is a whole range of different compounds issued from different parts or systems of the ship. In order to figure out how to work with the ship, trails must be run. Gunnar is subject to such a trial",,,"He starts as a test subject in the LAB. Strange things are happening to the subjects. He wants OUT. Escapes. The MPs chase him down. Corner him. There are Casualties. Both Gunnar and the MPs disregard public safety and take drastic measures.

He gets cornered. Shootout. Nothing is left. He's done some terrible things. But still he won't admit defeat. And the inevitable is interrupted by the coming of the tragedy. 

He is wrenched free by disaster, and given the opportunity to start again out in Camelot."
Mabby,"
Carny / performer. Does 'exotic' dance and whatever. jumps bikes. Their show is in town for the celebration. Set up tents near the airfield. Doing evening entertainments and shit. She gets in a flirtatious altercation with a guy that results in them racing motorbikes after hours. They are out all night, or at least until very late. She gets into an argument (of sorts) with Tyler

Mabby does some acrobatics, mostly with machines. Sphere cage motorcycle loops (whaddya call that thing?) crazy shit with a little gyrocopter maybe - maybe there's a little flight group that does aerial stunts and such - a wingwalker and more.",,,
"Chuckles, the Ironically Named Mechanic","an old bitter alcoholic. He works on the machines. Keeps them in order. doesn't get along with Mabby. Doesn't get along with anyone, really. But especially with Mabby. She's too flamboyant. Mistreats the hardware. His people skills aren't the best. He loves his machines and his booze.

when they are picked up out of the wreckage of the city and hauled into the body of Camelot, he begins immediately looking for copper tubing and pipes and tanks and such. Not immediately to rebuild his workshop, but to build a *still.* his first thought is about booze and securing his supply. He meets Gunnar and they work on the project together, bonding in quiet labor and understanding.",,,
