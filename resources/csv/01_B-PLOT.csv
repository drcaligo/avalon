ACT,B PLOT
summary,Flight of the Parzifal

Mabby and Tyler go from outcast teenage drag-racer circus performers to folk heroes among the civilian population of the Camelot
ACT ONE,"Mabby wins an aerial drag-race. It's her first major victory. she stays up all night, drinking with Tyler, celbrating their success."
ACT TWO,"Mabby zooms into the no-fly zone, much to Tyler's dismay. Alarms begin to sound. There is a flurry of activity on the ground. Fighters scramble, the Camelot weapon systems come on line. Tyler panics, but it quickly becomes apparent that the Camelot is responding to something else"
ACT THREE,"The Camelot Folds space to the outer solar system, taking much of the city with it.

Mabby and Tyler and their little racer are wrenched out into space. 

The Camelot maintains power to its fold system -- it maintains a pocket of space slightly outside of 'normal' dimensional space, keeping the atmosphere intact.  the crew scrambles to save as many survivors as they can, focusing experimental gravity manipulators to pull people and buildings and everything into the hold.

The little racer is pretty much destroyed, but Mabby and Tyler come out relatively unhurt.

A huge section of the city is floating out in space - miraculously there is air. Tyler and Mabby make their way onto the Camelot"
ACT FOUR," while many scour the wreckage (now inside the massive interior bay of Camelot) for survivors, Tyler searches for salvagable goods. 

He meets Gunnar, who is doing something similar. Salvaging hardware and strange looking technologies from a ruined lab. A kid (maybe 12), Percy, is hanging around, playing an arcade game console that he's reconnected. he's found a power source -- done some tricky and dangerous rigging to tap into the ship's power grid.

They work together. Gunnar provides much technology and equipment. (Tyler's workshop was outside of the Fold-zone).

They rebuild Gunnar's lab and with equipment from the wreckage, they are able to set up an impressive workshop.

They take the brains of the racer and build a new ship. a little Tank. Tyler doesn't know what else to do. he has access now to equipment that he could never get his hands on back and home, and if he doesn't work on something, he's afraid he'll just crumble into despair and nothingness.

Percy doesn't talk much, but when Gunnar and Tyler are struggling with some coordinates, trying to determine their location by the view of space, Percy rattles of an impressive sequence of mathematical and navigational skill. He's placed them out beyond Pluto, in the outer solar system, in the direction of Leo 

Gunnar wants to install some mysterious hardware, a PHASE LANCE. He and Tyler fight about it. They don't install it"
ACT FIVE,"A small patrol of Old Ones engages the Camelot. Several Shoggoth units get inside and begin wiping out any struggling civilian survivors they can find in the wreckage. 

Mabby gets inside the new Parzifal and engages the Shoggoth. She is able to distract them and draw them away from the impromptu hospital that has been set up, but they keep hitting her with energy weapons and projectiles. little missile / grenades.

Percy works wonders as a spotter / navigator, pointing out avenues of approach and withdrawal and opportunities for evasive actions. They manage to cripple one of the units--it collapses into the rubble.

But they are cornered and running out of options, the new Tank is damaged severely, and the shoggoth are closing in on the hospital. 

When it looks like all may be lost, Gunnar climbs onto a sagging roof carrying a power-pack and the PHASE LANCE. He hurls a charge, draining the power-pack and destroying the remaining Shoggoth units -- vaporizing them while causing minimal collatoral damage (though he is burnt quite badly and collapses into unconsciousness).

Tyler decides to redesign the tank and install the PHASE LANCE package"
