ACT TWO,"# FOUR
In the Ship, Carroll is confronted by the Weird Sisters. He has dreamed of this.
They give him misleading prophecy. False sense of security.--
        you will be in power, and you shall not be killed so long as there is earth beneath this city, and sky over it's head. But your son will be king.
Son? I have no son.
You have. Ask the priest, say the sisters.

Carroll confronts Merlaine. 
Where is he? Carroll demands. My son. Bring him to me. "
ACT THREE,"# FIVE
Carroll is losing his grip. He doesn't sleep. He refuses to leave the ship. He doesn't cooperate with medical examiners. there is some question of replacing him before the mission launch. Other officers have been discussing his state of mind, and plan to request action from high command.
Merlaine comes sweeping onto the bridge with an autistic child in tow.
What's this? Carroll demands.
Your son.
No son of mine, Carroll says. He threatens violence, foams at the mouth.
He rages powerfully. Is delusional. Officers try to hold him down. He shouts praises to the Old Ones.
Mathuin Dove (dove being a state-given name issued to many orphans) moves to the center console of the bridge. 
The thing lights up. Systems come on line that have never been on line -- so long as any here have been present. The entire ship seems to respond to Mathuin, anticipating his every move. He reaches toward a handle and draws a massive sword from the console.
Energy courses through him. The ship folds into the outer solar system, drawing much of the city with it. The city no longer has earth beneath it, no longer has sky above it, Carroll realizes, looking out the portal into the blackness of space as the officers stab him to death."
