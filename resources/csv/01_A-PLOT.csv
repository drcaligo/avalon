ACT,A PLOT
summary,"So this is Launch day. The Camelot is about to take a maiden voyage -- an unveiling strictly for publicity purposes. Things go terribly wrong. The government had been incorporating little-understood alien technologies into the ship, and when they launch, The Ship tears the City free from the earth out into the upper atmosphere.

Camelot forces do what they can to bring all survivors onto the ship. They save what they can. 

The launch activates dormant functions of the alien technologies. 

The Old Ones arrive from the great Beyond, presenting a threat the likes of which Earth has never seen.

The earth is bombarded with massive attacks (The Old Ones have Awoken!). What remains of the city of Odessa is taken aboard the Camelot, which has folded space to the outer reaches of the solar system, losing its capacity to fold in the process.

After regrouping, the Camelot sets out to return to earth, where it might be of use in the fight against the Old Ones -- if it can get there in time!
"
ACT ONE,"The Camelot, out on the island of Avalon, is preparing for it's commissioning ceremony.
---
Some PR representative for the Gov't takes press on a very limited tour of the ship.
Avalon is home to cutting-edge research and science. 
The Camelot is touted as a revolutionary breakthrough in space-age technology. More than a kilometer long, with the ability to carry more than five cubic kilometers worth of cargo (Avalon has been--among other things--producing dimension-folding technologies and releasing them into the public sector [though Avalon is a military research and development facility]), the Camelot heralds a brand new era in space travel and exploration. 
The Camelot is being unveiled as part of a 35-year plan. An experimental exploratory mission is being mounted to test gravity drive capabilities with a small crew. They will explore the outer reaches of the solar system, search for harvestable resources and return. 
---
Captain Aemond Carroll is being taken to Camelot. 'Is this your first time seeing it?' one of his companions asks. It is.
---
Carroll walks through certain areas that have been opened up to the press. They ask him questions about his assignment.
due to Carroll's success in a previous military engagement, the admiral has him this command on Camelot. He is a war hero of high order, and this command is a high. Someone mentions Commander Tintagel, who's death (under strange circumstance) paved the way for Carroll's carreer advancement. 
---
Carroll is escorted from public areas into security-clearance required areas. The non-public areas begin to look very strange. The materials have an organic appearance. somewhere between living flesh and steel and other expected construction materials. He is taken to a secret room somewhere in the heart of the ship, where he meets three witches, the only survivors of the crash. They are strange cackling beings that are connected to the ship. He can't tell if they are surgically attached or if they are growing out of the ship's neural network"
ACT TWO,"Carroll accepts the bridge. at the conclusion to the ceremony, he is taken to the heart of the ship to meet the Weird Witches
Merlaine tries to convince Bors to be lenient with Karl"
ACT THREE,Crisis on the bridge. Mathuin draws the sword. Ship folds to the outer Solar system
ACT FOUR,"The crew is caught off guard. Nothing like this was supposed to happen, let alone even be possible. They spot the remnants of the city floating outside the ship and scramble to save what they can once they realize there is still an atmosphere out there. 
Mathuin starts speaking in weird tongues. states that the space fold system is maintaining a super-dimensional pocket around them. he will do what he can to hold the pocket, but ship power is low, having not been exposed to raw solar radiation for some time. 
They open the cargo bays and deploy what work crews are available to collect survivors.
A scout patrol from the Old Ones folds into the area and attacks them. 
The Old Ones are able to penetrate the Interdimensional Pocket without trouble, but the Camelot crew isn't able to send out any ordinance. they are helpless while they are running the rescue effort.
They scramble and direct gravity manipulation beams onto the wreckage, forcibly collecting neighborhoods that are in (relatively) good shape other than losing gravity. there are fires and other traumas. The collection process causes much damage, but gives at least some chance for the civilians to survive.
Shoggoth fighters get inside the ship and attack the survivors and cleanup crews."
ACT FIVE,"Fighting dies down. Under control. The ship is stabilized, all remaining civilians and supplies have been brought aboard and the ship is sealed.
Another wave of Old Ones materializes. Earth looks doomed. Appears to be destroyed by the assault. 
Mathuin is able to guide Camelot into another Fold."
