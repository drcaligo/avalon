# Eioan Boyd on the Avalon

<!-- It comes as a result of the research that the ship operates on different principles than our own technologies. It is more akin to a living organism -- which comes as no surprise. Historically/ mythologically, these things have been portrayed as Leviathan ... as the great beasts of the outer world, of the heavens. They periodically come close to earth, visiting the outer atmosphere, entering into the Earth's biosphere temporarily. perhaps to pull in air, perhaps for other reasons (latest, mechanistic, thinking has it). Every time they enter into the biosphere, the earth's population is swept by strangely coherent visions - everyone has the same nightmare, night after night. Or at least something related. Violent incident spikes. Hospitalization, incarceration, madness. All of these things are violently magnified and influenced. -->

<!-- The leviathan crashed under strange circumstance, without apparent crew ... but the interesting thing is that there was control quarters, housing areas ... clearly there was space for a population of generally humanoid creatures. I hesitate to use the word 'design,' for it is not clear the structure was designed and not born, grown or evolved. -->

<!-- The more we studied and entered into the process, the more we have discovered ways to interface with the guiding systems - the nervous system of the thing. But it is like a beached whale. It is dying here. There may be something it needed in the atmosphere, but without the raw radiation of unprotected space, the systems are failing. -->

<!-- The ship certainly has certain things in common with an organism. It has provisions for things that could be considered sub-organisms. like blood-cells or bacterial cultures ... a living system that makes up a larger living organism. Perhaps something like a hive populated by bees or wasps.  -->


Either way, it has been bled dry of its natural inhabitants. More importantly: will we be able to transplant the original inhabitants? if the thing is indeed a living creature, it may reject any human crew as foreign organs. If it is as a hive -- a non-living thing, it should be easy for us to repopulate it and repurpose it. as many creatures invade the homes of other things in our own natural world. Take the hermit crab, for example. they take the shell belonging to a snail and make their home inside of it. We could do the same.

But if it is as a living organism, the transplant will be much more difficult.

Our research has been inconclusive. Results come down on either side of the matter, but with leanings toward the ship as a living system. It is slowly draining of power. Power that keeps the self-maintaining properties of the thing operational. If it is a machine, we should be able to re-power these systems even after they wind down and expire. But honestly, Captain, we have been unable to discover anything that might allow us to re-power anything here. 

It is my personal assesment that the ship is dying. If we don't get her out into open space, she won't make it much longer.

"How much longer?"

"The team's official report gives her to the end of the month. But personally ... I don't think she'll last the week."  

It might be that she'll accept a human crew ... but it might be that she is just too weak to fight us off at this point. We'll be an unnatural part of her composition, either way. There are some ideas we have, some proposals to ease any rejection she might start to enact ... like the drug treatments we give to organ transplant recipients. but ... there has been no real testing ... we are making blind guesses.

<!-- We've been doing clinical trials of some of the hormones found on board the ship - hormones created by organ-like systems within the ships makeup. Hormones that facilitate action within the ship systems, as well as ... there are places in the ship where these hormones are excreted in such a way as to be intentionally administered to the humanoid crewmembers ... -->

"Blind guesses?"

"Educated guesses. We are looking at physiology and technology ... software and systems ... drawing what analogies we can. We aren't basing these proposals and studies on nothing. There is much disagreement between the different scientists. There is only one thing we all agree on: There isn't much time. If we want to move forward with this, we have to take it out of the atmosphere."

"Out into space."

"That's right. Most of our science officers are extremely dedicated to the project. We have all volunteered to be on board. But this is an extremely dangerous proposition. Anything can happen out there. I wouldn't demand that anyone be a part of this mission without understanding the risks involved. Of course, the way the military handles this is not up to me ... but I would only take volunteers. Volunteers that have been made to understand the risks very clearly."

"I understand your concerns. But officers that have been privy to this project are unable to back out at this point. They have been assigned their orders, they understand the risks of military service."

"But these risks are unlike any risks we have ever faced. This is unknown territory. You know what these things can do to the psyche from the upper atmosphere. Sure it's been dormant, benevolent even, for these past years. But what happens if it starts to recover ... and we are out there with it. inside of it."

"I'll take your perspective under advisement."

"The thing is, Captain ..."

"Yes?"

"We need to get launch proceedings underway as soon as possible. Immediately, if we are to have a real chance at reviving this thing. We've recommended a skeleton crew to keep the basic systems functioning. We have built on a docking system that should support our own shuttle methods. Non-essential crew members should cycle out every shift, never spending more than six hours on board--"

"You want shuttles docking every six hours?--"

"That's right. We've already been granted approval for the use of the Weir orbital station as a staging area
