ACT ONE: scene two: King Aeuralius Ambrosius in answer to Carroll & Blanquo's victories, announces Carroll's promotion to command of the battlecruiser CAWDOR -->

		this is the first time Carroll turned to Merlaine for help. He committed an act of betrayal that caused the commander of the CAWDOR to be marked as a traitor. There was an inquest, a tribunal, and Carroll asked for absolution. Merlaine took away the memory of having committed the crimes in question. but as Merlaine says, there is a great price to pay - Carroll loses some of his ability for introspection, some of his moral fiber ... he becomes more ruthless, less able to understand the difference between right and wrong.

ACT ONE: scene three: Carroll dreams of the Wyrds - they greet him as 'lord of the GLAMIS' (which he is), 'commader of the CAWDOR,' and 'King to be'(blood of kings?).

Later, at a public function (Cawdor's court-marshalling?), Carroll talks to Igraine. He promises her riches and power for her husband. He urges her to be cold, to be hard, and to take him to her bed. she must do the hard thing sometimes, if she wants to see a future. Igraine agrees.
	
<!-- Carroll considers what he is about to do. he is playful. in a sense wants to be turned down. Doesn't want to go through with it, but doesn't have the self-control ... he is wracked with guilt, and tries to back out, but Igraine (perhaps unintentionally) convinces him that it is too late to step down. -->

# Act 2, 

ACT TWO: Scene 1: Past midnight, at Blanquo's place, Carroll and Blanquo talk about the future. Carroll sends Blanquo to chase chimeras, and goes to sleep with his wife.

		He tries to justify it as some romantic notion -- you cannot interfere where matters of the heart are concerned ... love knows no boundaries, etc. But he tells blanquo something to get rid of him, without thinking the consequenses through. He *knew* ahead of time that there was great danger in something, whatever that something was ... but he either forgot about it or ignored it because sending Blanquo into the trouble was the surest way to get into his wife's panties.

	Blanquo is hoodwinked. asked to turn a blind eye ... his trust is abused by Carroll. Carroll points at conspiracy elsewhere, something to distract and occupy Blanquo. He lies to him in order to take his wife

Igraine and Carroll conspire to kill her husband so they might be together. They kill him, and frame his bodyguards, making it look like they were part of an assasination plot of some kind.

Carroll is so shaken by the murder that he brings the bloody daggers with him, and Igraine takes them from him, to place them with the bodyguards they are framing. It is very early in the morning.
